# Introduction 

Welcome to the Biome Nodes project! We are currently in the development phase and are excited to invite contributors to join us. The purpose of this README is to provide a placeholder for information on contributing to our project. If you are interested in contributing, you've came to the right place.

# Contributing

Before contributing to this repository, we kindly request you to initiate a discussion with the repository owners via an issue, email or any other means of communication. This is to ensure that any changes or contributions made align with the goals and objectives of the project.

By engaging in a discussion with the repository owners, you can seek guidance on the best approach to make a contribution and receive feedback on your proposed changes. This helps to ensure that your contributions are aligned with the vision and mission of the project and that any potential conflicts are resolved amicably.

## Pull Request Instructions

### General guidelines
1. **Be clear:** Please, ensure that your pull request has a clear title and description of the changes made.

2. **Be descriptive:** Please, provide as much information about your fix/modification/feature as possible. Don't hesitate to submit media, especially if it will be helpful. 

3. **Be clean:** Please, make sure that you have properly documented your code. Nobody would want to read unclear and not documented code. This will also be taken into account by reviewers.

* ### Code Style

    * #### C++:
        - Follow the [C++17 Style Guide](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).
        - Use modern C++ features whenever possible.
        - Use consistent naming conventions for classes, functions, and variables.
        - Write safe and robust code.
        - Handle errors and exceptions properly.

    * #### Python:
        - Follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for naming conventions, code layout, and style.
        - Always use type hinting in function parameters and return values.
        - Use annotations for class attributes and methods.
        - Use [MyPy](https://mypy-lang.org/), [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for PEP and static type checking(submit output if there is).
        - Submit the errors to the Pull Request.

> Those are indeed arbitrary guidelines and they won't be evaluated strictly. However, it's always easier to read clean code.
